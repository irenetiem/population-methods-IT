    "## Naive Bayes decoding\n",
    "---\n",
    " Bayesian decoders are a simple but powerful tool for decoding the value of a stimulus from the observed neural activity.\n",
    " Let $P(s)$ denote the probability of presentation of stimulus $s$ (belonging to a set $S$) and $P(r|s)$ denote the conditional probability of obtaining a population response $r$ (out of a response set $R$) when stimulus s is presented. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write the probability of the stimulus given the response:\n",
    "\n",
    " $$P(s|r) = \\frac{P(r|s)P(s)}{P(r)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation gives the posterior probability that, given a response $r$, stimulus $s$ was presented. \n",
    "Bayesian decoding calculates from this posterior probability distribution a single prediction of the most likely stimulus, i.e. the maximum of the posterior distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a neural population, $P(r|s)$ lives in an $N$ dimensional space, where $N$ is the number of observed neuron, and its estimation can be a daunting problem. We can, however, make the simplifying assumption that the activity of each neuron is independent.In this case, we can factorize likelihood as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(r|s)=\\prod_{i=1}^{N}P(r_{i}|s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, since we are generally interested in finding the maximum of the posterior distribtuion, we often do not need to evaluate the denominator $P(r)$ (which is usually difficult to calculate).\n",
    "Moreover, if the prior $P(s)$ is flat (each stimulus value is equiprobable a priori), the problem simplifies further, and we are left with the follwing expression for the decoded stimulus value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s^{*}=argmax_{s}(\\prod_{i=1}^{N}P(r_{i}|s))$$\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of decoding methods is not limited to measure the amount of information that a neural population carries about a specific set of stimuli, or to predict what stimulus is present at a given time. It is extremely useful to interpret the content of neural activity when no stimulus is present and such activity is spontaneously generated by the network and is not elicited by a specific stimulus. \n",
    "In the case of the hippocampus it has now been extensively observed that during rest periods (either while the animal is standing still, waiting somewhere, or while it is sleeping) place cells reactivate specific patterns of activity corresponding to sequences of locations in the environment. This phenomenon, called \"replay\" is thought to be critical for the formation of memory, for the acquisition of novel knowledge and for the reorganization of different sorts of information in the brain (You can read [this review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0166223610000172?via%3Dihub) for an overview on this vast and ebullient field of research).    \n",
    "Here we want simulate the occurrence of such reactivation events. Some of them will actually contain sequences, that is, the neural activity will represents a series of locations in the order they appear on the linear track. Other reactivation events will instead contain activity representing locations of the linear track, but these locations will be randomly drawn, so they will present no clear ordering. "
